## üéØ What‚Äôs Inside

- **Responsive web UI** with company catalog, tier filters, and a full-screen deal analysis workspace.
- **REST + diagnostics APIs** for company search (`/api/companies`), deep dives, admin cache workflows, and health probes.
- **Instant-start ML runtime** that boots in seconds, warms in the background, and persists models/tier precomputes to disk.
- **KaggleHub + offline data pipeline** with automatic credential discovery, cached `investments_VC.csv` failsafes, and synthetic fallbacks.
- **PowerShell + shell tooling** for reproducible startup (`run_web_app.ps1`), smoke tests, and automation scripts.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### 1. Launch with the PowerShell Bootstrap (Windows)

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\jamie\OneDrive\Documents\Deal Scout\flask_app"
.\run_web_app.ps1
```

The script will:

- Ensure Python is present and create a local virtual environment (unless `USE_VENV=0`).
- Install pinned dependencies.
- Enable the instant-start defaults (fast bootstrap, lazy training, probability tempering, caching).
- Auto-load Kaggle credentials from `flask_app/kaggle.json` when available.
- Launch the Flask development server on http://localhost:5000 with auto-reload enabled.

### 2. Manual Setup (Cross-platform)

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\jamie\OneDrive\Documents\Deal Scout\flask_app"
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
set FLASK_ENV=development
set AUTO_TRAIN_ON_IMPORT=false
python app.py
```

> For macOS/Linux replace the PowerShell commands with the equivalent `source venv/bin/activate` workflow and environment exports.

## üåê Web Experience

- **Company Explorer:** Paginated grid with search, raw/normalized industry filters, region filters, funding round, success status, and attractiveness tier selectors (Invest ‚â•65%, Monitor 50-64%, Avoid <50%). Tiers are precomputed for instant filtering.
- **Deal Analysis Modal:** One-click deep dive per company, component score breakdowns, radar charts, risk factors, and investment commentary.
- **Admin Banner:** Quick links for Kaggle status, data source, tier precompute triggers, and cache clearing.
- **Diagnostics Overlay:** `/__debug/info`, `/__routes`, and `/api/diagnostics/*` endpoints surface build IDs, cache health, and score distribution audits.
- **Instant-start workflows:** Background training keeps the UI responsive; tier score caches persist across restarts.

## üåê Public Deployment with ngrok

Deploy your local Flask app to a public URL in minutes using ngrok:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\jamie\OneDrive\Documents\Deal Scout\flask_app"
.\start_ngrok.ps1
```

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Public HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://your-app.ngrok-free.dev`)
- ‚úÖ Share with anyone instantly
- ‚úÖ No deployment infrastructure required
- ‚úÖ Real-time traffic monitoring
- ‚úÖ Works on mobile devices

**Documentation:**
- **Complete Guide:** [flask_app/NGROK_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](flask_app/NGROK_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)
- **Quick Reference:** [flask_app/NGROK_QUICK_REF.md](flask_app/NGROK_QUICK_REF.md)
- **Setup Complete:** [flask_app/NGROK_DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.md](flask_app/NGROK_DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.md)

> **Note:** ngrok creates temporary public URLs. Free tier URLs change on each restart. Upgrade to Pro for persistent domains.

## üß† Machine Learning Pipeline

- **Ensemble classification**: grid-searched RandomForest, HistGradientBoosting, ExtraTrees, Logistic Regression, and soft voting with tuned probability thresholds. Achieves 60-75% accuracy.
- **Regression models** for funding and valuation recommendations (R¬≤ typically 80-85%), trained on aligned feature matrices.
- **Feature engineering**: 44+ features including consolidated industry/region groupings, efficiency ratios, log transforms, categorical encodings, and probability calibration.
- **Stricter Scoring (Schema 2025-10-01-stricter-tiers)**:
  - Success probability: 70% weight, mapped (0.25-0.85) ‚Üí (0-1) for higher selectivity
  - Lower base rates: operating companies 28% (was 40%)
  - Hard gating: sp<0.40 caps at 49 (Avoid), sp<0.50 caps at 64 (Monitor)
  - Distribution normalization DISABLED to allow natural scoring
- **Tier Thresholds**: Invest ‚â•65, Monitor 50-64, Avoid <50 (raised from 60/45 for selectivity)
- **Expected Distribution**: ~10-20% Invest, ~30-40% Monitor, ~40-60% Avoid (natural from strict scoring)
- **Performance**: Fast bootstrap (<1s) + background training (10-30s); cached models load instantly on restart
- **Caching strategy**: model artifacts + tier precomputes stored under `flask_app/.model_cache/` with SHA-based signatures; admin endpoints manage lifecycle.
