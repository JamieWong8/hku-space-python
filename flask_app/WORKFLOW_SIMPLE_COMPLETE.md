## 💡 Real-World Example

**Complete walkthrough of analyzing "CloudTech Inc":**

```
Company: CloudTech Inc
Founded: 2018 (6 years old)
Funding: $15M (3 rounds)
Industry: Software
Status: Operating

AI Analysis:
→ Success probability: 68%
→ Funding efficiency: $5M/round (good)
→ Growth rate: Moderate

Score Calculation:
→ 68% success → 72 pts × 70% = 50.4
→ $5M/round → 70 pts × 15% = 10.5
→ Moderate growth → 60 pts × 10% = 6.0
→ Operating → 28 pts × 5% = 1.4
----------------------------------------
Total: 68.3 points → INVEST ✅
