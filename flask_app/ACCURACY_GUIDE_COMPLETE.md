## üéØ Document Structure

### 1. Quick Summary (Lines 1-50)
**Content:**
- The 4 big questions answered upfront
- Report card analogy for understanding accuracy
- Quick facts: 75% correct, tested on 8,000 companies

**Key Points:**
- ‚úÖ 75% accuracy = B+ grade
- ‚úÖ Better than coin flip (50%)
- ‚úÖ Comparable to human experts (70-80%)

**Content:**
- Training vs testing explained
- What 75% accuracy actually means
- Comparison to human performance

**Analogies Used:**
- "Like a student taking a test"
- Study material = 40,000 companies
- Test questions = 8,000 unseen companies
- Final grade = 75% correct

**Visual Aid:**
```
Out of 100 companies:
‚úÖ 75 predictions are correct
‚ùå 25 predictions are wrong
```

---

### 3. Validation Methods (Lines 151-300)
**Content:**
- The "Time Machine" method explained
- 80/20 train/test split
- Why AI never sees test data during training

**Key Concept:**
```
48,000 Total Companies
    ‚Üì
Training Set (80%)         Test Set (20%)
38,400 companies           9,600 companies
Used to teach              Used to grade
```

**Real-World Example:**
- Pretend you're in 2020

- Real numbers: 650 correct Invest, 300 false alarms, 350 missed opportunities

**Key Insight:**
```
When Deal Scout says "Invest":
- 7 out of 10 succeed (70% precision)
- 3 out of 10 fail (false alarms)

Of all successful companies:
